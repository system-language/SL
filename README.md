# System Language

## About

System Language (SL) is a proposed formal language for defining systems in any domain. It is a description language that can be used to facilitate deep sytems analysis along with systems modeling and visualization across all domains including business, government, and science. 

SL is outlined at a high-level in [Systems Science: Theory, Analysis, Modeling and Design](https://www.amazon.com/Systems-Science-Theory-Analysis-Modeling/dp/3030934810). The goal of this project is to develop a minimum-viable implementation of SL in order to assess its utility as a practical tool for systems analysis.

## SL Components
SL allows us to describe any system in natural languge, graphical, and mathematical terms. It is comprised of five core components: A mathematical definition of a system, a graphical user interface (GUI), a markup language, a scripting language, and a system knowledgebase.

### Mathematical Definition
A system *S* is defined as:

$$S_{i, l}=C, N, G, B, T, H, \Delta t_{i, l}$$

C = a set of the sytem's components

N = a graph of internal interactions between system components

G = a graph of external interactions between the system and the environment

B = a boundary

T = a set of transformation rules describing how components transform inputs into outputs

H = an object representing the system's memory, or record of state transitions

T = a time interval relevant to the level of the system of interest

See [this essay](https://systemexplorers.substack.com/p/a-mathematical-definition-of-system) for a more detailed description of the definition.
