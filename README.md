ðŸ“£  We're looking for researchers and engineers who are passionate about systems science to help us build the foundation of a next-generation language that will usher in an era of systems-oriented programming. We also would love to have conversations with anyone who is already doing or plans to do systems modeling in order to understand their needs and desired features.

# System Language
System Language (SL) is a proposed formal language for defining systems that can be used to describe any system in natural languge, graphical, and mathematical terms. It can be applied to systems in all domains including business, government, and science. 

We envision SL as the foundation for an open-source "Figma for systems science" that can makes complex systems analysis, modeling, and visualization more intuitive and widely accessible.



## About
The vision for SL is outlined in [Systems Science: Theory, Analysis, Modeling and Design](https://www.amazon.com/Systems-Science-Theory-Analysis-Modeling/dp/3030934810). The goal of this project is to develop a minimum-viable implementation of SL in order to assess its utility as a practical tool for systems analysis.

SL was inspired by [George Mobus'](https://directory.tacoma.uw.edu/employee/gmobus) experience with creating realistic models of the energy system. He found that existing systems modeling software tools like [Stella](https://www.iseesystems.com/store/products/stella-online.aspx) and [UML](https://www.uml.org/) were lacking in expresiveness and completeness.


## SL Components
SL is comprised of five core components: 

1. [A mathematical definition of a system](https://shingai.notion.site/Mathematical-Definition-2d466fcb0e41401fa8e071d379f0c0a8?pvs=4)
2. [A graphical user interface (GUI)](https://shingai.notion.site/GUI-860e11dc6ac045839e189fe2539ecdc4?pvs=4])
3. [A markup language](https://shingai.notion.site/SysXML-a222a22d790f4e249fde4a637f9df8a0?pvs=4)
4. [A scripting language](https://shingai.notion.site/Scripting-Language-73b2a34fb372409fab9df016462cb5fc?pvs=4)
5. [A system knowledgebase](https://shingai.notion.site/Knowledgebase-687efd77287c4c00b55ff47a38d97b18?pvs=4)
